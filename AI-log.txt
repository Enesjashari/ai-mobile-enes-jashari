How to run the mobile app (quick guide)
1) Prerequisites (install if needed)
    - Git
    - For React Native / Expo: Node.js (>=14), npm or yarn, Android Studio (Android SDK). For iOS: Xcode.
    - For Flutter: Flutter SDK, Android Studio, Xcode (macOS).
    - Ensure an Android emulator or physical device is available; for iOS use Simulator or device.

2) Clone the repository
    git clone <REPO_URL> my-mobile-app
    cd my-mobile-app

3) Common workflows

React Native (bare)
    # install deps
    npm install   # or: yarn
    # start metro
    npx react-native start
    # in a new terminal:
    npx react-native run-android   # Android
    npx react-native run-ios       # macOS + Xcode for iOS

Expo (managed)
    npm install -g expo-cli        # if not installed
    npm install                    # or: yarn
    expo start
    # Use Expo app on device or emulator (scan QR or press a / i)

Flutter
    flutter pub get
    # run on connected device or emulator
    flutter run
    # target specific device:
    flutter devices
    flutter run -d <device_id>

Native Android (Gradle)
    ./gradlew assembleDebug
    # then install:
    adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
    # or open project in Android Studio and Run

Native iOS
    open ios/YourProject.xcworkspace
    # build & run from Xcode (select a simulator or device)

4) Troubleshooting
    - Read project README.md for project-specific steps and environment variables.
    - If build fails, install missing SDKs, accept Android SDK licenses, or run `flutter doctor` / `npx react-native doctor`.
    - Clean and reinstall:
      rm -rf node_modules && npm install
      flutter clean && flutter pub get
      cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..

Replace <REPO_URL>, my-mobile-app, and project-specific names with values for this repository.
